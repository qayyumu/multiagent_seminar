      "AttributeParametersDescriptionTaskstasksA list of tasks assigned to the crew.AgentsagentsA list of agents that are part of the crew.Process (optional)processThe process flow (e.g., sequential, hierarchical) the crew follows. Default is sequential.Verbose (optional)verboseThe verbosity level for logging during execution. Defaults to False.Manager LLM (optional)manager_llmThe language model used by the manager agent in a hierarchical process. Required when using a hierarchical process.Function Calling LLM (optional)function_calling_llmIf passed, the crew will use this LLM to do function calling for tools for all agents in the crew. Each agent can have its own LLM, which overrides the crewâ€™s LLM for function calling.Config (optional)configOptional configuration settings for the crew, in Json or Dict[str, Any] format.Max RPM (optional)max_rpmMaximum requests per minute the crew adheres to during execution. Defaults to None.Memory (optional)memoryUtilized for storing execution memories (short-term, long-term, entity memory).Cache (optional)cacheSpecifies whether to use a cache for storing the results of toolsâ€™ execution. Defaults to True.Embedder (optional)embedderConfiguration for the embedder to be used by the crew. Mostly used by memory for now. Default is {\"provider\": \"openai\"}.Step Callback (optional)step_callbackA function that is called after each step of every agent. This can be used to log the agentâ€™s actions or to perform other operations; it wonâ€™t override the agent-specific step_callback.Task Callback (optional)task_callbackA function that is called after the completion of each task. Useful for monitoring or additional operations post-task execution.Share Crew (optional)share_crewWhether you want to share the complete crew information and execution with the crewAI team to make the library better, and allow us to train models.Output Log File (optional)output_log_fileSet to True to save logs as logs.txt in the current directory or provide a file path. Logs will be in JSON format if the filename ends in .json, otherwise .txt. Defaults to None.Manager Agent (optional)manager_agentmanager sets a custom agent that will be used as a manager.Prompt File (optional)prompt_filePath to the prompt JSON file to be used for the crew.Planning (optional)planningAdds planning ability to the Crew. When activated before each Crew iteration, all Crew data is sent to an AgentPlanner that will plan the tasks and this plan will be added to each task description.Planning LLM (optional)planning_llmThe language model used by the AgentPlanner in a planning process.Knowledge Sources (optional)knowledge_sourcesKnowledge sources available at the crew level, accessible to all the agents.\n",

      "   - Example:\n",
      "     ```python\n",
      "     from crewai import CrewBase, agent, task, crew\n",
      "\n",
      "     @CrewBase\n",

      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Adding Memory**: You can utilize the `memory` attribute in the crew definition. \n",
      "   - This can handle short-term, long-term, and entity memory, which enhances the decision-making process and execution strategies.\n",
      "   - Example:\n",
      "     ```python\n",

      "To set up a CrewAI for a safe city and add memory and tools to your agentic system, you can follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Define Your Crew**: Use a class that inherits from `CrewBase` and employ decorators to manage agents and tasks. Here is a simple example to illustrate this:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   from crewai import CrewBase, agent, task, crew\n",
      "\n",
      "   @CrewBase\n",
      "   class SafeCityCrew:\n",
      "       @agent\n",
      "       def city_monitor_agent(self):\n",
      "           return Agent(role=\"City Monitor\", goal=\"Monitor city activity.\")\n",
      "\n",
      "       @task\n",
      "       def analyze_traffic_task(self):\n",
      "           return Task(description=\"Analyze traffic data.\")\n",
      "\n",
      "       @crew\n",
      "       def crew(self):\n",
      "           return Crew(agents=[self.city_monitor_agent()], tasks=[self.analyze_traffic_task()])\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Adding Memory**: You can utilize the `memory` attribute in the crew definition. This can manage short-term, long-term, and entity memory, which enhances decision-making and execution strategies. For example:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   @crew\n",
      "   def crew(self):\n",
      "       return Crew(\n",
      "           agents=[self.city_monitor_agent()],\n",
      "           tasks=[self.analyze_traffic_task()],\n",
      "           memory={\"short_term\": {}, \"long_term\": {}}\n",
      "       )\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Integrate Tools**: Make sure to define tools that your agents can utilize. You can integrate custom tools or built-in ones. Hereâ€™s an example of how to define a tool:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   from crewai_tools import SomeCustomTool\n",
      "\n",
      "   @agent\n",
      "   def traffic_analysis_agent(self):\n",
      "       return Agent(\n",
      "           role=\"Traffic Analyst\",\n",
      "           tools=[SomeCustomTool()]\n",
      "       )\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Kickoff the Crew Execution**: Use the `kickoff()` function to start your execution process as structured:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   my_crew = SafeCityCrew().crew()\n",
      "   result = my_crew.kickoff(inputs={})\n",
      "   print(result)\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Monitor Output and Logs**: It's important to track the logs and outputs to gain insights from the execution for further improvements. You can do this by setting `output_log_file=True` during the execution to save logs.\n",
